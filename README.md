## Extraction

1. Put the leaf and beads into a 2.0 mL tube and freeze it with liquid nitrogen.
2. Grind the leaf sample with tissue lyser.
3. Add 200 µL of DNA extraction solution and mix well with voltex.
4. Centrifuge at 15,000 rpm, 25°C for 10 min.
5. Transfer the supernatant to a new 1.5 mL tube
6. Centrifuge at 15,000 rpm, 25°C for 10 min.
7. Add 150 µL of 2-propanol and mix invertedly.
8. Centrifuge at 15,000 rpm, 25°C for 10 min.
9. Discard the supernatant and wash with 500 µL of 70% EtOH.
10. Centrifuge at 15,000 rpm, 25°C for 5 min. if needed.
11. Dry the pellet at 65°C.
12. Dissolve the pellet with 30 µL TE buffer.
13. Measure the conc. and check the quality with agarose gel electrophoresis.
14. Store the DNA solution at -20°C. (Store at -80°C for long-term storage.)
